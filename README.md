# on-sense-and-reference
This translation of Frege’s On Sense and Reference is part of a larger project comparing Western philosophy with علم الكلام and المنطق الإسلامي. It’s especially useful for those studying علم الكلام, offering a chance to see how Western ideas on logic and meaning measure up to the depth of Islamic thought.
